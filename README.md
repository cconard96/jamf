# /!\ This plugin has a new home /!\
To ensure this plugin can continue to be maintained and improved for many years to come, responsibility for the plugin has been transferred to Teclib'.
Given that this plugin involves the integration of a paid product with GLPI, with a potentially small number of GLPI users wanting this integration, it will be available under the GLPI-Network subscription moving forward.
This repository will be archived, but remain public.
If you need assistance with a community version of the plugin, please reach out via the [GLPI community forums](https://forum.glpi-project.org) or the [GLPI Discord server](https://discord.gg/BYQ47ZjWMS).
The last community release will be version 3.1.1.

# JAMF Plugin for GLPI

Syncs data from JAMF Pro to GLPI.

## Requirements
- GLPI >= 9.5.0
- PHP >= 7.2.0
- Jamf Pro >= 10.20.0

## Usage
- Server/sync configuration is found in Setup > Config under the JAMF Plugin tab.
- JSS User account used must have read access to mobile devices at least. Additional access may be required depending on what items are synced (software, etc).
- The two automatic actions "importJamf' and 'syncJamf" can only be run in CLI/Cron mode due to how long they can take.
- There is a rule engine used to filter out imported devices. The default import action is to allow the import.
- iPads and AppleTVs are imported as Computers, while iPhones can be imported as Phones or Computers.
