# Jamf Plugin for GLPI Changelog

## [3.1.1]

### Fixes

- Fixed missing API connection checks for some API calls.
- Fixed missing password config option during plugin installation.
- Fixed default PMV file path which is used during the plugin installation/v3.0 update.
- Fixed URL reference in the merge page's pager controls.
- Fixed select all checkbox on the import page.
- Fixed some blocking errors when merging devices.
- Fixed the computer type config option remaining after the plugin is uninstalled.
- Fixed unicity errors when discovering devices.

### Changed

- Updated included PMV (product model/OS version support) file to the latest version from Apple.
- Improved the permission error message when accessing the plugin's menu without access to any of the individual plugin pages.
- Migrated HTML code from `/front` files to Twig.
- Overhaul of the automatic tests to help ensure a stable release.
  - Migrated from Atoum to PHPUnit.
  - Added PHPStan level 1 checks.
  - Updated the mock data.
- The config option to ignore the SSL certificate verification is now disabled by default. If you have issues connecting to your Jamf instance over HTTPS, you probably don't have the root certificate installed/trusted for Curl. You should verify this is configured correctly (look up the specific instructions for your OS/distribution).
- The merge page now ignores deleted and template assets when determining merge candidates.

## [3.1.0]

- The plugin now uses the bearer token authentication with the Jamf API. The plugin still uses a standard username and password to get the token though, so there is no change from the point of view of GLPI admins.
- UUID is now fetched when the plugin discovers computers and this field will also be used when suggesting GLPI assets for merges.

## [3.0.2]

### Fixes

- SQL error when fetching the Jamf device linked to a GLPI asset

- Fixed potential issue with the sync automatic action if the sync interval configuration value is missing or invalid

## [3.0.0]

- The UI was redone a little bit to match the new UI added in GLPI 10 better
- The plugin now adds information to the GLPI status check system meaning you can now monitor this plugin's connection to your Jamf server
- You can specify a version when using the Update MDM command. The versions listed will be restricted to versions released by Apple and marked compatible with that device's model.
